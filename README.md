### Web Server Installation

This is used to deploy the UI interface, when it's deployed it can be accesed through "localhost:8080/WebInterface/".
We decided to use TomCat 8.0, and we use some PATH variables from TomCat in the API package, so it's of great importance
to use the version included inside the Git.
